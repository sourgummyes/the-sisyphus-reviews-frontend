Commit once You've Completed a File or Added a Major Feature-Ask Everyone Else to Stop What They're Doing, Allow you to Commit, and then Pull Down as Follows

The person doing the commit will complete all steps up to "Git checkout main" and EVERYONE, including the person who committed will complete enter the remaining commands to clone down and ensure that they're working off of their own branch.

If there is a conflict while committing, then the person committing shares their screen, and everyone looks at a it together to ensure that there is consensus in the resolution of the conflict of the code--ideally, this flow will avoid conflicts when committing altogether. We should all communicate which file we're working in and ask the team before we switch into another file to ensure no one else is working in that file.
