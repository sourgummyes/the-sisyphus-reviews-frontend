# The Sisyphus Review

![alt text](<image (2).png>)

## Description 
The Sisyphus Review is a book review website where users can sign up, sign in, peruse books and book reviews, write their own reviews, and edit or delete their own reviews as needed. The back-end application is built with Express and Node, while the front-end application is built with React. The project implements JWT token-based authentication for user sign-up, sign-in, and sign-out, and authorization is enforced across both the front-end and back-end. Guest users (those not signed in) cannot create, update, or delete data in the application or access functionality allowing those actions. The project has full CRUD functionality on both the back-end and front-end.

## Background 
The Sisyphus Review was built to provide a platform for book enthusiasts to share their thoughts and opinions on various books. The goal was to create a user-friendly and secure environment where users can easily manage their book reviews.
